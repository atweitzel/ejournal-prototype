# CC E-Journal Prototype

## Background

This repository holds all the files under construction for a prototype e-journal hosted by the DC Creatives Club. The project and its code are currently managed by Alex Weitzel - but never fear, you too can contibute to the project! Alex is available day or night (but mostly day) on the CC Discord, just feel free to drop a DM.

The journal is still in its infancy, with the first major step being defining page layouts and gathering the most relevant information. Volunteers are welcome to contribute to the development of the site. When the site is in a good spot, we will issue a call for submission for the first issue. The current target for the first issue is the mid-point of 2024.

## Goals

The journal has 3 major goals:

1. To provide a platform for local artists (primarly members of the DC Creatives Club) to showcase their work in thematic volumes and a polished space.
2. To limit our environmental impact by following [sustainable web design practices](https://sustainablewebdesign.org/guidelines/).
3. To foster a publication that is as accessible as possible by following [WCAG 2.2 guidelines](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/) for accommodating the widest possible participation.

## Design Philosophy

Birthed out of an appreciation for the [Web Revival movement](https://wiki.melonland.net/web_revival) and an affection for [brutalist web design](https://brutalistwebsites.com/), this yet-unnamed journal is being designed with simplicity in mind. Monospace fonts and a constrained color palette impart a kind of nostalgia for the web before Squarespace.

In support of the Creatives Club philosophy, this project is intended to be open for contribution by the community of inspirational artists that make up the group. Anyone is welcome to make suggestions and contribute to this undertaking as it grows and changes. 

Think of this journal like a house -- blueprints are generated in the goals above and a framework is scribbled hurriedly onto notebook pages, HTML walls are built in place to create a solid structure, and a cadre of designers may choose to install their art in the empty door and window frames, paste it along the walls, or arrange it as they desire within. With each issue, a new room is added, and the process may begin again. The house expands ad infinitum so long as artists choose to contribute to its construction.

In tandem with creative design, this website is intended to limit processing power, and therefore energy consumption, both in hosting and accessing content. As a result, the design is aimed to be simple and static. Relatively few moving parts, complicated scripts, and outside links will help achieve a more energy-conscious web environment.
